Merging Logs
============

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6wH-Hifd2uAcaNBMDE4iUH4NBCs6u8vjnkbDWMU8h0/edit for instructions.

Approach

Ideally I wanted to use Observables as an abstraction to solve both problems, since observable represents "value over time" it fits great for async log source and sync log source is just a sub-set of async. Converting both log sources to observables is pretty trivial task, but then I figured that to solve this efficiently I'd need to write a custom operator "merge sorted observables". Spending few hours researching this I understood that it's not easy and requires advanced understanding of Observables and their internals. I was able to find an [implementation in Java](https://gist.github.com/akarnokd/c86a89738199bbb37348) that made it's way to RxJava, but as you can see that code is far from easy to understand.

That would be an ideal implementation, but far too complex for now.

So here I was looking for alternatives... ðŸ˜…

Node Streams was my next obvious choice, but then I realized that I'd have to stick with that programming model and force consumers to use pipe(), while I still thought Observables could be more useful and feel arguable more natural (I am biased there). So next idea was to use generators and write a generic function that merges arbitrary sorted sequences. So I did that and then modified it to work for sequences of promises. Async version returns an Observable that represents "merged logs over time".

It turned out to be pretty elegant solution, the drawback is that there is code duplication. There is no easy way to refactor sync version and async one to re-use some code since control flow is different. (even though it looks similar thanks to library "co" + generators). Which is not a big deal and in production that likely to be only one version (async is my bet).

As a bonus I did performance test of few priority queues https://github.com/lemire/FastPriorityQueue.js/issues/5. Also normally I set up Babel to use ES Next goodness which I didn't do in this case since boilerplate is been provided.

Please start reading from index.js and follow along my comments for more detils.

I had a lot of fun!

>Consider what would happen when you're asked to merge 1K log sources, or even 1M log sources.  Where might your bottlenecks arise?

For 1M sync log sources bottleneck would be CPU time for, but the complexity of my solution is O(k*log(n)) which is as fast as it gets. It could be improved to be 3-4x faster, but that's it. It can scale horizontally! Nothing prevents us from partitioning 1M log sources into multiple nodes and then merging results of their merge.

For 1M async log sources bottleneck is async itself, the speed with which sources arrive. Current approach is sequential, it waits for every item to arrive and then moves to the next one, this can be improved with some buffering. I don't know the exact strategy, but it can be figured out with trial and error, for instance we can have a separate "async virtual process" that buffers log sources in parallel to significantly speed up their arrival. That has to be throttled so it doesn't overflow memory and efficiency of which depends on log times dispersion across the sources. If logs are close to each other and we do a lot of switching in between sources then buffering "few from each" strategy is best, if logs times are not dispersed much and we won't switch often then buffering "current source more and others less" would work better.

Observables could help with making above buffering strategies very straightforward.
